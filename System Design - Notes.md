System Design:

==============



Inheritance:

-------------



Allows one class to inherit properties and behaviours from another class. It helps avoid duplications of code by enabling a new class to reuse code from a existing class. 

A subclass (Child class) class can inherit from super class (Parent class) using extend keyword.



Types of Inheritance:

&nbsp;	Single Inheritance

&nbsp;	Multilevel Inheritance

&nbsp;	Multiple Inheritance

&nbsp;	Hierarchical Inheritance

&nbsp;	Hybrid Inheritance



Inheritance lets a subclass use the methods and fields of its superclass, promoting code reuse and hierarchy



Code reusability

Improves code organization

supports polymorphism

Establishes parent-child relationships



=============================================================================================================================



Polymorphism:

--------------



Polymorphism means "Many Forms" - ability of an object to take an many forms, allowing you to call the same method name on different classes and get different behaviours.

Two main types:

&nbsp;	compile time polymorphism --> method overloading

&nbsp;	run  time polymorphim ---> method overriding using inheritance





Feature		Method Overloading		Method Overriding

Defined In	Same Class 			Subclass

Parameters	Must be different		Must be same

Return type	can be same or different





=============================================================================================================================





Abstract Class:

---------------



Abstract Class:

&nbsp;	is like a blue print for creating other classes. its a class that cannot be instantiated on it own, but it provides a structure that other class can follow.

&nbsp;	Think of it as a partially built house - you cant live in it, but you can use it as a starting point to built a complete house



Interface:

&nbsp;	An interface is like a contract that a class must follow. It defines a set of methods that a class must implement, but it does not provide any implementation itself (only method signatures).

&nbsp;	Think of it like a remote control interface â€” it tells what buttons are available (methods), but not how the TV responds to each (implementation). The class that "implements" the interface decides what each button actually does.





|||| Abstract Class                         |||| Interface                          ||||

----- ------------------------------------- ----- --------------------------------- -----

abstract class payment {                   |||| interface payments {               ||||

&nbsp;   void processPayment();                 ||||     void paymentMethod();          ||||

&nbsp;                                          ||||     boolean isCompleted();         ||||

&nbsp;   boolean isCompleted() {                |||| }                                  ||||

&nbsp;       Print("Yes!");                     ||||                                    ||||

&nbsp;   }                                      ||||                                    ||||

}                                          ||||                                    ||||

Cohesion And Coupling

---------------------



Cohesion:

1. Cohesion is the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.
2. A module with high cohesion contains elements that are tightly related to each other and united in their purpose
3. A module is said to be have low cohesion if it contains unrelated elements
4. Highly cohesive modules reflect higher quality of software design



Coupling:

1. Coupling is the degree of interdependence between the modules
2. Two modules have high coupling or tight coupling if they are closely connected and dependent on each other.
3. Modules with low coupling among them work mostly independently of each other
4. Loose coupling reflects the higher quality of software design.







&nbsp;           Cohesion

High  ------------------> Low



&nbsp;           Coupling

High  -------------------> Low









Types of Cohesion:

&nbsp;	Degree of cohesion moves from low to high

&nbsp;	1. Coincidence Cohesion (Worst)

&nbsp;		Modules having no meaning relationship.

&nbsp;		Example: Class contains 2 functions:

&nbsp;			Calculate bill

&nbsp;			Printing Logo



&nbsp;	2. Logical Cohesion

&nbsp;		Modules are grouped because they fall under the same category, but perform different task.

&nbsp;		Example: A CAB Service App Project

&nbsp;			Developer

&nbsp;			Marketing

&nbsp;			DevOps

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	3. Procedural Cohesion

&nbsp;		Functions are grouped because they execute in a specific sequence.

&nbsp;		Example: A Authentication System

&nbsp;			Take credentials from user

&nbsp;			Check permissions

&nbsp;			Give token and authorize

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	4. Sequential Cohesion

&nbsp;		Functions are grouped because output of one is the input of next function

&nbsp;		Example: Calculation radius, area, circumference of circle

&nbsp;				

&nbsp;	5. Functional Cohesion (Best)

&nbsp;		All modules contribute to a single well defined task.

&nbsp;		Example: Web Development

&nbsp;			1. Model: Entity

&nbsp;			2. Service: Operations

&nbsp;			3. Repository: To perform database task

&nbsp;			4. Connection termination

&nbsp;			5. Config

&nbsp;			6. Utils 









Types of Coupling:

&nbsp;	Worst to Best

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	1. Content Coupling (Worst)

&nbsp;		One Module directly modifies another's internal data or logic

&nbsp;		Example:

&nbsp;		class Account{

&nbsp;			private double bankBalance;

&nbsp;		}

&nbsp;		

&nbsp;		class Hacker{

&nbsp;			void steal(Account account){

&nbsp;				Account.bankBalance = 0;

&nbsp;			}

&nbsp;		}



&nbsp;	2. Common Coupling (Bad)

&nbsp;		Modules share global data across whole process

&nbsp;		Example:

&nbsp;		class Credentials{

&nbsp;			String username;

&nbsp;			String password;

&nbsp;		}

&nbsp;		

&nbsp;		class Login{

&nbsp;			

&nbsp;		}



&nbsp;		class Registration{

&nbsp;		

&nbsp;		}

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	3. Control Coupling 

&nbsp;		One module controls the logic another module

&nbsp;		Example: Binary Search depends on the sorting.



&nbsp;	4. Stamp Coupling

&nbsp;		Modules shares a composite data structure like object, json, xml, but only use a part of it

&nbsp;		Example: After logging a system module got whole user details

&nbsp;			For Welcome Page only need username

&nbsp;			For ChechOut Page only need of address and phone



&nbsp;	5. Data Coupling (Good)

&nbsp;		Modules are communicating via simple data parameters

&nbsp;		User\_id

&nbsp;		Get\_user\_name(user\_id)

&nbsp;		Display\_user\_data(user\_id)		

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	6. No Coupling(Independent Module)

&nbsp;		Modules have no interaction

&nbsp;		Example: Creating a connection module --> Logger Module.





=============================================================================================================================





Separation OF Concerns:

-----------------------

&nbsp;	The development process has too many different responsibilities. User Interface design, database process, exception handling, and many other tasks can be examples of responsibilities.



What does MVC look like? 

&nbsp;	Request

&nbsp;	------->  Controller 

&nbsp;	|	      |

&nbsp;	|	  Logic File

&nbsp;	|	      |

&nbsp;     User	    Model

&nbsp;	|	      |

&nbsp;	|	    View
	|	      |

&nbsp;	---------------

&nbsp;          Response





Monolithic or Layered Architecture:

&nbsp;	Examples: Creating database 

&nbsp;	Handling request response

&nbsp;	UI

&nbsp;	Message Part

Microservices Architecture:

Model-View-Controller (MVC):

### SOLID PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN PRACTICES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------



&nbsp;	Tells the way to write a code.

As a software systems grow, they tend to become complex and harder to change. A Small change in one part can cause unexpected issues elsewhere. this is rigidity and fragility in code.


Common problems in large codebases:
---

&nbsp;	Tight Coupling

&nbsp;	Low Cohesion

&nbsp;	Code Smells

&nbsp;	Difficult Testing and Maintenance





##### Birth of SOLID Principles:

&nbsp;	Developers Start building large scale systems, they noticed these recurring issues.

&nbsp;	Need for guidelines to make software, 	



#### SOLID:


S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
---

&nbsp;	- A Class should have a single responsibility 

&nbsp;	- If a class has many responsibility, it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to one of the it responsibility, could affect the other ones without you knowing

###### Goal:

&nbsp;	This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it wont affect other unrelated behaviours.

&nbsp;       Each class has a single responsibility and easily able to extend

&nbsp;       Testing of business logic become easy

&nbsp;	

##### O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)

&nbsp;	- Class should be open for extension but close for modification.

&nbsp;	- Changing the current behaviour will affect all the systems using that class.

###### Goal:

&nbsp;	This principles aim to extend a class's behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that class.
	This avoid causing bug wherever the class is being used

##### 

##### 

##### L - Liskov Principle (LSP)

&nbsp;	- When a child class cannot perform the same action as its parent class, this can cause bugs.

&nbsp;	- The child class should be able to process the same requests and deliver the same result as the parent class or it could deliver a result that is of the same type.



Home Work:

Add Invoice:
Ad feature following OCP:

New Feature: Send notification using SMS.





##### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

&nbsp;	- Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

&nbsp;	- Separate the class based on the tasks.



###### Goal:

&nbsp;	This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a class executes only the set of actions it requires.



Home Work:

Document Converter Class:

convertToPDF();

convertToWord();

convertToJPEG();



###### BENIFITS:

&nbsp;	- Classes are not burdened with unnecessary tasks or methods

&nbsp;	- Interfaces become role specific

&nbsp;	- Promotes flexibility, modularity and maintainability



##### D - Dependency Inversion Principle

&nbsp;	- High Level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction

&nbsp;	- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction

&nbsp;	- *High-Level Module:* Class that executes an action with a tool.
	- *Low-Level Module:* The tool that is needed to execute the action

&nbsp;	- *Abstraction:* Represents an interface that connects the two classes

&nbsp;	- *Details:* How the tools works



###### Goal:

&nbsp;	This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level class on the low-level class by introducing an interface.







##### Advantages of SOLID Principles:

&nbsp;	- Achieve the reduction in complexity of the code

&nbsp;	- Increase readability, extensibility, and maintenance

&nbsp;	- Increase scalability, code flexibility, and readability

&nbsp;	- Achieve Better Testability

&nbsp;	- Reduce tight coupling

&nbsp;	- Reduce error and implement Reusability

&nbsp;	- Increase Parallel development
